# Blog Post

Since round about the same time last year I've been trying to get my deisgn systems game up to stracth. In this post I'm gonna walk you through how I built two design systems and made component libraries in Vue and React. If you follow along you could also build yours in no time at all. However the outputs are really bare bones and the goal is to get your design system out in the wild to be used in your apps and marketing activities. 


## why do design systems exist? 

Design systems exist purely because they help companies provide a consistent brand and user experince for their products or services. 

Your users are everywhere your brand is. Web, mobile, print, film and clothing are just a few places where your customers/users interat with your brand.

Design systems help bridge the gap between these diffferent platforms and give your team guidelines on how to execute the design and brand.
