# Blog Post

Since round about the same time last year I've been trying to get my deisgn systems game up to stracth. In this post I'm gonna walk you through how I built two design systems and made component libraries in Vue and React. If you follow along you could also build yours in no time at all. However the outputs are really bare bones and the goal is to get your design system out in the wild to be used in your apps and marketing activities. 


## why do design systems exist? 

Design systems exist purely because they help companies provide a consistent brand and user experince for their products or services. 

Your users are everywhere your brand is. Web, mobile, print, film and clothing are just a few places where your customers/users interat with your brand.

Design systems help bridge the gap between these diffferent platforms and give your team guidelines on how to execute the design and brand.

## how can they improve my ability

### Proptype faster

When building out stuff you want to make sure that you're able to make sure your business requirements are sound. So when making hifidelity prototypes the cognitive load of managing the styling of your app and still making sure the use cases are valid can really eat you up. 

So lets take a look at this file:

[ADD SCREENSHOOTS FROM THREE USE CASES IN FIGMA]

This took me about 30mins to do, while looking over a use case that has three different alternative steps. Because I was able to easliy drag and drop components willy nilly I was able to focus on business requirements and get approval from stakeholders.


### Avoid sharing code between components

At Pimp My Book where I work, we have a bursary app called GOA which helps bursary students order their educational materials and aids bursaries to cut down on wastage. So I had initally made a landing page in Vue, then a month later I needed a tool to help me with documentation for the app. So I use Gridsome, when starting on the docs site I was copying and pasting code between projects. It was really ugly and painful, but I did not have the time to stop and make a lib at the time.

## Phases of building them

### Overview of design phase

### Design tools: choose one

### Use premade components


### Focus on colours & typography

 ### Shouldnâ€™t take more than five days

### Overview of engineering  phase

### Choose framework

###  Choose CSS framework

### Component viewer

### CI/CD + Publishing
