# Blog Post WIP!!

Since round about the same time last year I've been trying to get my deisgn systems game up to stracth. In this post I'm gonna walk you through how I built two design systems and made component libraries in Vue and React. If you follow along you could also build yours in no time at all. However the outputs are really bare bones and the goal is to get your design system out in the wild to be used in your apps and marketing activities. 


## why do design systems exist? 

Design systems exist purely because they help companies provide a consistent brand and user experince for their products or services. 

Your users are everywhere your brand is. Web, mobile, print, film and clothing are just a few places where your customers/users interat with your brand.

Design systems help bridge the gap between these diffferent platforms and give your team guidelines on how to execute the design and brand.

## how can they improve my ability

### Proptype faster

When building out stuff you want to make sure that you're able to make sure your business requirements are sound. So when making hifidelity prototypes the cognitive load of managing the styling of your app and still making sure the use cases are valid can really eat you up. 

So lets take a look at this file:

This took me about 30mins to do, while looking over a use case that has three different alternative steps. Because I was able to easliy drag and drop components willy nilly I was able to focus on business requirements and get approval from stakeholders.


### Avoid sharing code between components

At Pimp My Book where I work, we have a bursary app called GOA which helps bursary students order their educational materials and aids bursaries to cut down on wastage. So I had initally made a landing page in Vue, then a month later I needed a tool to help me with documentation for the app. So I use Gridsome, when starting on the docs site I was copying and pasting code between projects. It was really ugly and painful, but I did not have the time to stop and make a lib at the time.

## Phases of building them

So I went through two phases: design and engineering

Out of the design phase you need to come out with a UI Kit in a design tool of your choice, while in the engineering phase you need a component library packaged for your platform. 

### Overview of design phase
I'm a bit of a one man team at the moment. So it is not smart to over design in this phase but rather keep things simple. If you're in a larger team I would still recommend that you try to keep this stage simple and make sure engineers are particpaing in your plans for what the components will look like. Because you could come up with a design that your enigneering team might not know how to pull off and it will just take longer for the components to be shipped because they now have to go out of their to figure out how to bring your over deisigned components to life. 

### Design tools: choose one

When it comes to design tools, it is easy to get overwhelmed. So I will make the decision for you! FIGMA is the only way!

There are tonnes of tools which can be looked at here [insert link to deisgn tools]. 

Why Figma

It is free, you have all the serious functionality to be productive without needing to fork out moneny. 

It is primarily based on the web so it solves accessibility problems without needing to have certain OS or device. 

Neat advanced features like local styles and access to your components. [Supply links to videos of local styles etc]

### Use premade components
If you are sitting in your tool and making components from scrtach like making a rectangle and adding widths, border radius etc then you're a wasteman/wastewoman. Time is precious, use premade UI libraries and then customize everything according to your colours and typography. 

I've been using this template and it is extremly useful. [pdkit.co]

### Focus on colours & typography

Once you set your colours and typography you are on the road to success. Simple go onto Dribbble or Pintrest and search for UI's you like and steal their colour palette. You need to have at least two base colours and accents. So If we look at GOA's DS, I have Green, then I go about two shades darker and two shades lighter. Then do the same for your accents, which will always be Yellow, blue, red, white and grey. For palettes go  to coolours or colourhunt.

For your typography simply take Two fonts from Google Fonts, One for headings and the other for your body text. Then have Five or Six main headings, Then have a body text, caption text. Most importanly, systemize your sizing for your fonts and also spacing. [Add picture of sizing]
